  abstract = {Significant attention has been given during the last few years to overcome technological and material barriers in order to develop organic photovoltaic devices (OPVs) with comparable cost efficiency similar to the inorganic photovoltaics (PVs) and to make them commercially viable. To take advantage of the low cost for such devices, major improvements are necessary which include: an efficiency of around 10\%, high stability from degradation under real-world conditions, novel optically active materials, and development of novel fabrication approaches. In order to meet such stringent requirements, the research and development in OPVs need to improve upon the short diffusion length of excitons, which is one of the factors that are responsible for their low power conversion efficiency. This review discusses some of the most significant technological developments that were presented in the literature and helped improve photovoltaic performance, such as tandem architectures, plasmonics, and use of graphitic nanostructural materials, among others. Tandem organic solar cells with embedded plasmonics are a promising approach to further increase the power conversion efficiency of organic solar cells, by harvesting complementary spectral regions with high quantum efficiencies. Polymeric nanocomposites incorporating graphitic nanostructures were extensively investigated for the next generation of efficient and low-cost solar cells, since such nanomaterials show excellent electrical and mechanical properties, excellent carrier transport capabilities, and provide an efficient pathway to the dissociated charge carriers.},

There is remarkably good agreement between the theoretical predictions and the measured XPS; in particular, the different full width at half maximum values for the C(1s) and N(1s) BEs are explained in terms of unresolved C(1s) BEs for the different C atoms in pyridine. This work demonstrates that the combination of theory and XPS measurements can extract analysis of the XPS relevant to the molecular electronic structure. The theory used is based on fully relativistic self-consistent field solutions of the Dirac–Coulomb Hamiltonian, and the SA is used to determine relative XPS intensities.},

TPA-QATPA contains branched alkyl chains for enhanced solubility and methoxytriphenylamine moieties (TPA) as end capping groups. The end capping groups not only extend the molecular conjugation leading to a red shifted emission, but have a propeller shaped conformation. The propeller design hinders the intermolecular p-p stacking, hindering aggregation and hence suppressing concentration quenching of the fluorophores in the solid state. The new molecular design shows good thermal stability, with a decomposition temperature of 390 C and a melting temperature of 295 C. The absorption and emission maxima for TPA-QA-TPA compound are 552 and 622 nm respectively. Using TPA-QA-TPA as a dopant in tris(8-hydroxyquinolinato)aluminum (Alq3), organic light emitting diodes were realized in a simple device structure.},

We found that quinacridone shows a field-effect mobility of 0.1 cm2/V·s, comparable to mobilities of pentacene in similarly prepared devices. Photoinduced charge generation in single-layer quinacridone metal-insulator-metal diodes is more than a hundred times more efficient than in pentacene devices. Photoinduced charge transfer from quinacridone to C60 is not effective, as evidenced by measurements in heterojunctions with C60.

We show that this class of materials generates photocurrent without the need of creating a donor–acceptor junction. Stable homojunctions were created both via vacuum-processible and solution-processible routes, with the latter method based on the chemical functionalization of the respective molecules with the thermolabile group, t-BOC, that affords solubility in various organic solvents and conversion back to the parent molecule via exposure to temperatures around 170~°C for periods not exceeding 30~min. We show that power conversion efficiencies around 0.15\% are reachable without scrupulous optimization of the homojunction cells in terms of electrode surface functionalization or film deposition conditions.

  abstract = {Die kohlenstoffbasierte (Nano-) Elektronik nutzt die herausragenden Eigenschaften des Graphens aus und präsentiert sich deshalb als ein sehr vielversprechenden Ansatz, um die Grenzen der siliziumbasierten Elektronik zu überwinden und um innovative und zukunftsträchtige elektronische Geräte zu entwickeln. Vor diesem Hintergrund stellt die supramolekulare Selbstassemblierung ein etabliertes Verfahren zur Bottom-up Herstellung von niedrigdimensionalen Nanostrukturen und Adsorbaten aus molekularen Einheiten dar, da diese mithilfe programmierbarer nichtkovalenter Wechselwirkungen leicht gesteuert werden kann. Bei näherer Betrachtung entpuppen sich die in diesem Kontext gemeinhin verwendeten Standardtechnologien allerdings als teuer und technisch aufwendig, was deren Anwendbarkeit für die großtechnische Herstellung von elektronischen Geräten stark einschränkt. In Anbetracht der oben genannten Beschränkungen wurde eine neue Depositionsmethode entwickelt, die den Namen ?Organic Solid-Solid Wetting Deposition? (OSWD) erhielt. Das zugrundeliegende, fundamentale Phänomen der Festphasenbenetzung tritt an der fest/fest Grenzfläche auf und erzeugt supramolekulare Adsorbatstrukturen direkt aus dispergierten dreidimensionalen (3D) organischen Halbleiterkristallen, und das unter Umgebungs-bedingungen und auf unkomplizierte Art und Weise. Die OSWD erfordert daher weder das Auflösen, das Schmelzen, noch das Verdampfen der Ursprungskristalle, was sie zu einem vielversprechenden Ansatz für verschiedene Forschungs- und Technologiebereiche macht. Zu Beginn der vorliegenden Dissertation fehlte jedoch ein tiefgreifendes Verständnis der physikalisch-chemischen Grundlagen des OSWD Prozesses, was die weitere Entwicklung von Methoden, den grundlegenden Effekt zu katalysieren, verhinderte. Dies machte eine Einschätzung der Potentiale der OSWD Technologie unmöglich, insbesondere für den Bereich der kohlenstoffbasierten Elektronik. Um diese Grundlagen nun zu erforschen, wurden Modellsysteme in ceteris paribus Ansätzen untersucht. Die Modellsysteme wurden zusammengesetzt aus verschiedenen Substratmaterialien (in hohem Maße gerichteter pyrolytischer Graphit (HOPG), Kohlenstoffnanoröhrchen, Graphen und Molybdändisulfid (MoS2)), variierenden wässrigen und organischen Dispersionsmedien, und aus einem von zwei organischen, halbleitenden Pigmenten (Gammachinacridon und Dimethylchinacridon) als den aktiven Phasen. Zur experimentellen Analyse der Modellsysteme wurden Rastertunnelmikroskopie (STM), Rastertunnelspektroskopie (STS), Raman-Spektroskopie und Rasterelektronenmikroskopie verwendet und darüber hinaus wurden die Partikelgröße, das Zetapotential und der pH-Wert analysiert. Zusätzliche Erkenntnisse über die Grundlagen der OSWD wurden mithilfe theoretischer Methoden wie z.B. durch Kraftfeldrechnungen und weiterentwickelte DLVO Simulationen gewonnen. Eine kurze Zusammenfassung der Erkenntnisse und Ergebnisse der vorliegenden Dissertation: ? Bis zu Temperaturen von mindestens 160 ?C weist die mittels OSWD erzeugte Adsorbatschicht eine ausgeprägte Domänenstruktur und eine nur partielle Bedeckung auf, die ihre Ursache in der limitierten Oberflächendiffusion und der Anisotropie der Bindungsenergie der 3D Halbleiterkristalle hat. Ab 240 ?C bildet sich jedoch eine großflächige, homogene und lückenlose Monoschicht. Darüber hinaus sind die erzeugten supramolekularen Adsorbate temperaturbeständig bis mindestens 300 ?C, mindestens 36 Tage lagerstabil, sowie feuchtigkeits- und wasserbeständig. ? Ein fundamentales Modell wurde vorgeschlagen, das zeigt, dass der OSWD-Prozess abhängig ist von einem komplexen Gleichgewicht physikalisch-chemischer Wechselwirkungen zwischen verschiedenen Komponenten im System. Infolgedessen durchläuft ein Halbleiterkristall, der sich einem Substrat nähert, verschiedene Teilprozesse, die die OSWD maßgeblich beeinflussen. Die katalytische Wirkung des Dispersionsmediums wird dabei maßgeblich von den elektrischen Doppelschichtkräften bestimmt, einschließlich der sogenannten Casimir-ähnlichen fluktuationsinduzierten Kräfte. Diese Kräfte lassen sich anhand des Zetapotentials quantifizieren. Für das Auslösen der OSWD ist darüber hinaus ein direkter physischer Kontakt zwischen Halbleiterkristall und Substrat essentiell, welcher insbesondere durch den Effekt der Entnetzung in einem hydrophoben und örtlich im Nanometerbereich begrenzten Raum ermöglicht wird. ? Auf der Grundlage des gewonnenen tieferen Verständnisses von der OSWD können jetzt unlösliche organische Halbleiter mithilfe neuer organischer oder wässriger Dispersionsmedien verarbeitet werden, wodurch sich die Produktionskosten der Technologie deutlich reduzieren. Darüber hinaus können das Adsorbatschichtdesign und die Oberflächenbedeckung (letztere zwischen 0,3 und 98 \%) jetzt auch global gesteuert werden. Dies wird ermöglicht durch die Vielzahl an geeigneten Dispersionsmedien, Additiven wie Salze, Säuren, Basen, sowie fortschrittlichen Probenvorbereitungs- und Nachbearbeitungstechniken. Die OSWD-Methode zeichnet sich somit durch ihre Umweltfreundlichkeit, eine freie Skalierbarkeit und großtechnische Umsetzbarkeit aus, und demonstriert damit ihre Wettbewerbsfähigkeit gegenüber den Standardtechnologien. ? Perspektivisch gestatten die in dieser Dissertation identifizierten vielfältigen Möglichkeiten zur Auslösung und Steuerung der OSWD die Verwendung der Methode in verschiedenen Verarbeitungstechnologien wie Tintenstrahldruck, Fallguss oder Rotationsbeschichtung. Darüber hinaus zeigten die STM- und STS-Analysen deutlich, dass Graphen mithilfe der OSWD chemisch dotiert werden kann. Dies ebnet den Weg für ein zukünftiges Bandgap Engineering von Graphen. Überdies ergibt sich ein deutliches Anwendungspotential für fortschrittliche elektrische Bauteile auf Basis von pigmentfunktionalisiertem Graphen und damit beispielsweise im Bereich der gedruckten und flexiblen kohlenstoffbasierten Elektronik.},

  abstract = {Semiconductor nanowires (NWs) represent a new class of materials and a shift from conventional two-dimensional bulk thin films to three-dimensional devices. Unlike thin film technology, lattice mismatch strain in NWs can be relaxed elastically at the NW free surface without dislocations. This capability can be used to grow unique heterostructures and to grow III-V NWs directly on inexpensive substrates, such as Si, rather than lattice-matched but more expensive III-V substrates. This capability, along with other unique properties (quantum confinement and light trapping), makes NWs of great interest for next generation optoelectronic devices with improved performance, new functionalities, and reduced cost. One of the many applications of NWs includes energy conversion. This review will outline applications of NWs in photovoltaics, thermoelectrics, and betavoltaics (direct conversion of solar, thermal, and nuclear energy, respectively, into electrical energy) with an emphasis on III-V materials. By transitioning away from bulk semiconductor thin films or wafers, high efficiency photovoltaic cells comprised of III-V NWs grown on Si would improve performance and take advantage of cheaper materials, larger wafer sizes, and improved economies of scale associated with the mature Si industry. The thermoelectric effect enables a conversion of heat into electrical power via the Seebeck effect. NWs present an opportunity to increase the figure of merit (ZT) of thermoelectric devices by decreasing the thermal conductivity (κ) due to surface phonon backscattering from the NW surface boundaries. Quantum confinement in sufficiently thin NWs can also increase the Seebeck coefficient by modification of the electronic density of states. Prospects for III-V NWs in thermoelectric devices, including solar thermoelectric generators, are discussed. Finally, betavoltaics refers to the direct generation of electrical power in a semiconductor from a radioactive source. This betavoltaic process is similar to photovoltaics in which photon energy is converted to electrical energy. In betavoltaics, however, energetic electrons (beta particles) are used instead of photons to create electron-hole pairs in the semiconductor by impact ionization. NWs offer the opportunity for improved beta capture efficiency by almost completely surrounding the radioisotope with semiconductor material. Improving the efficiency is important in betavoltaic design because of the high cost of materials and manufacturing, regulatory restrictions on the amount of radioactive material used, and the enabling of new applications with higher power requirements.},

Wearable physical sensors are an important part of wearable electronics. They can sense various physical signals from the human body or the surrounding environment and convert them into electrical signals for processing and analysis. Nanowires (NW) have unique properties such as a high surface-to-volume ratio, high flexibility, high carrier mobility, a tunable bandgap, a large piezoresistive coefficient, and a strong light–matter interaction. They are one of the ideal candidates for the fabrication of wearable physical sensors with high sensitivity, fast response, and low power consumption. In this review, we summarize recent advances in various types of NW-based wearable physical sensors, specifically including mechanical, photoelectric, temperature, and multifunctional sensors. The discussion revolves around the structural design, sensing mechanisms, manufacture, and practical applications of these sensors, highlighting the positive role that NWs play in the sensing process. Finally, we present the conclusions with perspectives on current challenges and future opportunities in this field.},

  abstract = {The last decade has seen remarkable new developments in the field of low energy electron diffraction (LEED) which are reviewed in the present paper. The arrival of sophisticated and fast techniques for the measurement of diffraction intensities in the early 1980s was a challenge to theory. Its answer was the development of tensor LEED (TLEED) in 1985. It allows the fast calculation of intensities for structures not too far from a certain reference. This made quantitative surface structure analysis approach new frontiers both with respect to structural complexity and-with the help of the routine use of reliability factors-to precision. Simultaneously, the new experimental techniques allowed access to two-dimensional intensity maps, i.e. the measurement of diffuse intensity distributions. Theory could be modified to calculate such distributions and so gave birth to the diffuse LEED technique (DLEED) which allows the retrieval of the local structure in case of disordered adsorption. The basics and the development of both TLEED and DLEED is reviewed. TLEED is the basis for direct methods and is used in effective search procedures for surface structures structurally close to a certain reference. It can also be used to simulate the substitution of surface atoms by different chemical species as well as to account for surface vibrations. In addition to carrying the information about the local structure, DLEED patterns very recently could be successfully interpreted in a holographic sense yielding real space images directly.},

  abstract = {The recent emergence of molecular films as candidates for functional electronic materials has prompted numerous investigations of the underlying mechanisms responsible for their structure and formation. This review describes the role of epitaxy in molecular organization on crystalline substrates. A much-needed grammar of epitaxy is presented that classifies the various modes of epitaxy according to transformation matrices that relate the overlayer lattice to the substrate lattice. The different modes of epitaxy can be organized hierarchically to reflect the balance of overlayer–substrate and molecule–molecule energies. In the case of molecular overlayers, the mismatch of overlayer and substrate symmetries commonly leads to coincident epitaxy in which some of the overlayer lattice points do not reside on substrate lattice points. Analyses of numerous reported epitaxial molecular films reveal that coincidence is quite common even though, based on overlayer–substrate interface energies alone, not as energetically favorable as commensurism. The prevalence of coincidence can be attributed to overlayer elastic constants, associated with molecule–molecule interactions within the overlayer, that are larger than the elastic constants of the overlayer–substrate interface. This condition facilitates prediction of the epitaxial configuration and overlayer structure through simple and comparatively efficient geometric modeling that does not require the input of potential energies, while revealing the role of phase coherence between the overlayer and substrate lattices.},

  abstract = {The adsorption and ordering of the prochiral molecule quinacridone (QA) on the Ag(100) and Cu(111) surfaces were studied by low-energy electron diffraction and scanning tunneling microscopy. Upon adsorption, the molecules form parallel homochiral chains of flat-lying molecules linked together via hydrogen bonds on both surfaces, but these chains show significant surface-dependent differences concerning their lateral order. On both substrates, the chains are not thermodynamically stable but only metastable and stabilized by kinetic barriers. On the Ag(100) surface, annealing induces a phase transition to a highly ordered and heterochiral structure with a reduced density of hydrogen bonds. The related loss of bonding energy is overcompensated by a stronger bonding to the substrate, yielding a commensurate structure. For QA on Ag(100), we propose that during the initial chain formation and the phase transition upon annealing, the molecules can change their handedness by rotating around their long axes. In contrast, the initial chain formation and the phase transitions of QA on the Cu(111) surface appear to be subject to stronger kinetic limitations. These are explained by stronger substrate molecule interactions on Cu(111), which reduce the diffusion and the possibility for a change of handedness in comparison to QA on Ag(100). We discuss how the intermolecular hydrogen bonds, the 2D chirality, and the different chemical reactivities of the two surfaces [Ag(100) and Cu(111)] influence the structural formation of QA aggregates. We compare our results to the results for QA on Ag(111) reported previously by Wagner et al. [JPCC 2014, 118, 10911-10920].},

The article provides a comprehensive review of the continuing efforts in exploring semiconductor nanowires for the assembly of functional nanoscale electronics and macroelectronics. Specifically, we start with a brief overview of the synthetic control of various semiconductor nanowires and nanowire heterostructures with precisely controlled physical dimension, chemical composition, heterostructure interface, and electronic properties to define the material foundation for nanowire electronics. We then summarize a series of assembly strategies developed for creating well-ordered nanowire arrays with controlled spatial position, orientation, and density, which are essential for constructing increasingly complex electronic devices and circuits from synthetic semiconductor nanowires. Next, we review the fundamental electronic properties and various single nanowire transistor concepts. Combining the designable electronic properties and controllable assembly approaches, we then discuss a series of nanoscale devices and integrated circuits assembled from nanowire building blocks, as well as a unique design of solution-processable nanowire thin-film transistors for high-performance large-area flexible electronics. Last, we conclude with a brief perspective on the standing challenges and future opportunities.},

Herein we elaborate a series of materials to make suitable gate dielectric and active semiconductor layers for high temperature stable OTFTs. We employ an anodized aluminum oxide layer passivated with crosslinked low-density polyethylene (LD-PE) to form a temperature-stable gate capacitor. As the semiconductor, we use quinacridone, an industrial organic colorant pigment produced on a mass scale. Evaporated MoOx/Ag source and drain electrodes complete the devices. Here we evaluate the performance of the OTFTs heating them in air from 100 °C in 25 °C increments up to 225 °C, holding each temperature for a period of 30 minutes. We find large differences in stability between quinacridone and its dimethylated derivative, with the former showing the best performance with only a factor of 2 decline in mobility after heating at 225 °C, and unaffected on/off ratio and threshold voltage. The approach presented here shows how industriallys calable fabrication of thermally robust OTFTs can be rationalized.},

The structure−property−performance relationships of many classes of ETMs, both small-molecule- and polymer-based, that have been widely used to improve OLED performance through control of charge injection, transport, and recombination are highlighted. The molecular architecture, electronic structure (electron affinity and ionization potential), thin film processing, thermal stability, morphology, and electron mobility of diverse organic ETMs are discussed and related to their effectiveness in improving OLED performance (efficiency, brightness, and drive voltage). Some issues relating to the experimental procedures for the estimation of relevant material properties such as electron affinity and electron mobility are discussed. The design of multifunctional electroluminescent polymers whereby light emission and electron- and hole-transport properties are combined in one material to achieve efficient single-layer OLEDs is also discussed. The review concludes with a brief perspective on the challenges that future research should address.},

The B1 phase of NaCl mixed with the silver was used both as a pressure transmitting medium and as an internal pressure calibrant. The data fitted to two forms of the Birch equation yield K0=1180±50 kbar, K0′=3.8±0.5, and K0=1105±95 kbar, K0′=4.6±0.8. When the pressure exceeded 300 kbar, the NaCl underwent a phase transformation to the B2 phase. Increasing the load did not result in the complete disappearance of the B1 phase up to a pressure of 311 and 334 kbar based on the extrapolation of the Ag and Re compression data, respectively. The average volume change measured for the B1-B2 transformation is −0.83±0.11 cm3/mole, which is 17\% smaller than the value reported by Bassett et al. This smaller volume change improves the agreement of NaCl with the linear relationship between volume change and entropy change proposed by Bassett et al. for the B1-B2 transformation in the alkali halides.},

Further details may be found elsewhere.(1–3) The major difficulty is common to all surface experiments, namely, to keep the surface clean. The UHV chamber will normally contain an array of techniques for cleaning the surface (provision for heating the sample, ion bombardment) as well as some means of detecting impurities at the surface, usually by detection of Auger signals from adsorbed atoms. LEED is very sensitive to cleanliness of the surface and small amounts of contaminant can produce quite spurious results. Experiments conducted on clean, perfect, surfaces can produce a large amount of structural information of high precision. Obviously it is only possible to produce precise data for surfaces which are well defined in the first place.},

A couple of recent studies (J. Phys. Chem. A 2015, 119, 5241–5249 and J. Phys. Chem. B 2016, 120, 2132–2137), however, have put forward a new sequence in which the amine group deprotonates before the phosphonate oxygen. In this study we present experimental and theoretical data with the aim of resolving the controversy over the order of the last two deprotonations. On the experimental side, we analysed the evolution of the N1s photoemission spectrum with the pH of the aqueous solution, finding conclusive evidence that the last deprotonation occurs at the amine group. On the theoretical side, we compared the stabilities of several configurations for each glyphosate moiety, finding again that the last group that undergoes deprotonation is the amine group.},

For analysis, the materials are grouped under one of the headings: element, inorganic compound, organic compound and adsorbed gas, with the path lengths each time expressed in nanometers, monolayers and milligrams per square metre. The path lengths are vary high at low energies, fall to 0.1–0.8 nm for energies in the range 30–100 eV and then rise again as the energy increases further. For elements and inorganic compounds the scatter about a ‘universal curve’ is least when the path lengths are expressed in monolayers, λm. Analysis of the inter-element and inter-compound effects shows that λm is related to atom size and the most accuratae relations are λm = 538E−2+0.41(aE)1/2 for elements and λm=2170E−2+0.72(aE)1/2 for inorganic compounds, where a is the monolayer thickness (nm) and E is the electron energy above the Fermi level in eV. For organic compounds λd=49E−2+0.11E1/2 mgm−2. Published general theoretical predictions for λ, valid above 150 eV, do not show as good correlations with the experimental data as the above relations.},

  abstract = {Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) unfurl mainstream lighting and display technology in consumer electronics. Over the last three decades, numerous approaches to material synthesis and device design have been implemented for improving OLED performance. For the constant demand for high-efficiency and long-lifetime OLEDs, the development of high-performance organic electroluminescence materials is of prime concern. Encouragingly, great progress had been made in the area of organic electroluminescence materials in recent years. The design and synthesis of a novel series of hole-transporting, electron-transporting, host and emitter materials have enabled OLEDs with remarkable operating characteristics. Hence, in this article, we reviewed the crucial material tactics employed to obtain high-performance OLED devices with small molecules, carbazole, fluorine, cross-linked, and metal oxide-based hole transport materials. The general properties of the charge carrier mobility, thermal stability, and structural configuration of hole transport materials are shown, and their significant effects on devices are discussed to understand device physics and improve the future performance and reliability of OLEDs. Moreover, the future perspectives and ongoing challenges of this research frontier are also highlighted.},

So, all four polymers showed a low HOMO level, thus showing high VOC. Among the four, the HOMO level of PQCT-BT was the lowest, by 5.63 eV.

The deposition is based on a solid–solid wetting phenomenon, whereas the subsequent layer growth proceeds according to standard models. Molecular adsorption results from direct contact of the compound in a nanocrystalline state with the solid surface. Based on complementary force field calculations, we propose that molecules disintegrate from the crystalline state and adsorb on the surface because of a gain in binding energy. The preparation method is exemplified by means of a linear hydrogen-bonded system, namely quinacridone (QAC) on graphite. In addition, the chosen system allows us to actively guide the self-assembly after deliberate removal of molecules from a predefined area.},

This resulted in the first efficient and bright red OLED based on a quinacridone derivative.           ,                             Quinacridone (QA) derivatives are long-established emitting materials for use in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). However, their role in OLEDs has generally been limited to green/yellow-green emitters. Herein, we report a QA-based red emissive OLED material, NPh               2               -QA, constructed through the introduction of two strongly electron-donating diphenylamino groups onto the QA core of green emissive               N               ,               N               ′-dioctyl-substituted QA. The green-to-red change is due to an alteration of the electronic transition responsible for the population of the S               1               state,               i.e.               from a QA-centered π → π* transition to an intramolecular charge-transfer transition. NPh               2               -QA can be easily synthesized and it exhibits efficient red emission, with a fluorescence quantum yield of 0.56 in toluene, as well as good thermal stability, with a decomposition temperature of 444 °C. By adopting NPh               2               -QA as a dopant emitter, for the first time, an efficient and bright QA-based red OLED has been realized.},

  abstract = {The structural modification of quinacridone, a widely used industrial pigment, produced a series of fascinating organic electronic materials that were used in OLEDs, OSCs and OFETs.           ,                             Organic electronic materials are a hot topic of both academic and industrial studies because of their wide range of applications in various fields,               e.g.               displays, lighting and solar cells. In the development process of electronic materials, quinacridone (QA) and its derivatives have attracted increasing attention due to their intriguing properties, such as intense fluorescence in the dispersed state, strong absorption in the visible-light region, good carrier-transporting properties, as well as high photo, thermal and electrochemical stability. To date, the applications of QAs as electronic materials have been extensively explored in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), organic solar cells (OSCs) and organic field-effect transistors (OFETs). The continuously improved performance of the QA-based electronic devices enables QAs to be used as an important material system. To summarize the achievements and drawbacks of this class of electronic materials so as to promote their further development, we review the existing knowledge on the synthesis, device performance and structure–performance relationships of QA-based electronic materials.},

  abstract = {Nanomaterials provide many desirable properties for electrochemical energy storage devices due to their nanoscale size effect, which could be significantly different from bulk or micron-sized materials. Particularly, confined dimensions play important roles in determining the properties of nanomaterials, such as the kinetics of ion diffusion, the magnitude of strain/stress, and the utilization of active materials. Nanowires, as one of the representative one-dimensional nanomaterials, have great capability for realizing a variety of applications in the fields of energy storage since they could maintain electron transport along the long axis and have a confinement effect across the diameter. In this review, we give a systematic overview of the state-of-the-art research progress on nanowires for electrochemical energy storage, from rational design and synthesis, in situ structural characterizations, to several important applications in energy storage including lithium-ion batteries, lithium-sulfur batteries, sodium-ion batteries, and supercapacitors. The problems and limitations in electrochemical energy storage and the advantages in utilizing nanowires to address the issues and improve the device performance are pointed out. At the end, we also discuss the challenges and demonstrate the prospective for the future development of advanced nanowire-based energy storage devices.},
