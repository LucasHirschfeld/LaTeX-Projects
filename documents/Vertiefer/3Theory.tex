\section{X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)}

\Acf{XPS} is one of the different types of electron spectroscopy where an excitation leads to the ejection of an electron from a bound state to the continuum, called the photoelectric effect.\autocite{Hertz1887, Einstein1905} The photons of x-rays have similar energy as the \acfp{BE} of deep core electrons and are therefore used for the excitation. One can divide x-rays for surface science into two different categories: soft (100 - 2100~\si{\eV}) and hard x-rays (> 2100~\si{\eV}).

When an atom absorbs one of these photons, a photoelectron, which has a characteristic energy corresponding to the atom and its bonding environment, is emitted. The change of energy due to the bonding environment and its oxidation state is called chemical shift.\autocite{Kolasinski2012}  A schematic drawing of this process is illustrated in \autoref{fig:XPS-schematic}

The kinetic energy of the photoelectron $E_\mathrm{kin}$, that is referenced against the Fermi level $E_\mathrm{F}$ for solid substrates by convention, is given by\autocite{Woodruff2016, Briggs1990}:

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:KineticEnergy1}
    E_\mathrm{kin} = h\nu - E_\mathrm{B},
\end{equation}

where $E_\mathrm{B}$ denotes the \acf{BE} of the photoelectron. Without referencing against $E_\mathrm{F}$, one would also take the work function of the sample $\phi_\mathrm{sample}$ into account:

\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:KineticEnergy2}
	E_\mathrm{kin} = h\nu - E_\mathrm{B}-\phi_\mathrm{sample}.
\end{equation}

 The \ac{BE} $E_\mathrm{B}$ of an electron is defined as the difference in energies between the atom with $n$ electrons and the ion with $n-1$ electrons:

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:BindingEnergy}
    E_\mathrm{B}=E_\mathrm{f}(n-1)-E_\mathrm{i}(n)~,
\end{equation}


As seen in this equation, the \ac{BE} of photoelectrons depends on initial and final state effects. The initial state effects manifest for the neutral unexcited atom, due to its interaction with its immediate electronic environment, also referred to as the chemical environment. In addition, final state effects emerge from the correlation between the photoemission process and the ionized final state. The rapid nature of the photoemission process may preclude the system from attaining adiabatic equilibrium.\autocite{Woodruff2016}

The final state effects are characterized by the presence of satellites with reduced kinetic energy, correlating to increased \ac{BE}. This is exemplified by phenomena such as shake-up lines or asymmetric line shapes of the signal, which are indicative of photoemission from the metal surface. The asymmetric line shapes result from coupling of the photoelectrons to the conduction electrons.\autocite{Moulder1993}
A multitude of factors have been identified as contributors to the line shape, particulary the \ac{FWHM}, of the photoemission lines. These include phonon broadening, the lifetime of the photohole, the spectral resolution of the exciting x-ray beam and the energy resolution of the analyzer.\autocite{Moulder1993,Fairley2021}
